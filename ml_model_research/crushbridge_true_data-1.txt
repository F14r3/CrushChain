This Valentine’s day ten years ago, at Cambridge, I didn’t ask anyone out, nor was I asked. And that’s OK. To those who are not lucky enough to find a partner during their time here, that’s OK. The years don’t have to take away the vitality in you, and you don’t have to lose yourself. Make this the Valentine’s Day that will change your life, sure, why not, if you have the opportunity. Yes, don’t waste a day. Yes, you can be strong now, kind now, love fiercely now. And if you ...

Those who are lucky enough to find a partner during your time here, please don't let them go. Never. University is a special time of your life, and once you get to work, e...

Tall and dashing in the tan suit jacket and striped (perhaps Trinity Hall) scarf (29/11)
I first noticed you unlocking your bike outside Causewayside when I walked by with a friend. She berated you for cycling on the sidewalk and I wanted to apologize for her, but your gentle little "sorry" caught my breath as you went by. I could hardly believe my luck when I found you sitting opposite me at Christ's carol service, could hardly keep my eyes off you in the candlelight. Walking out behind you, seeing you unlock your bike again, I so badly wanted to ask if you were going back the same way--if you would walk with me for some reason, any reason. Maybe it's the season, but I can't get those bright eyes out of my head. I'd buy all the mulled wine and minced pies to have a little Bridgemas rendezvous, if you'll just drop your name down below.

Dear B. This is more of a confession than a crush. Though as you shall see I have both a crush on you and your milk. What I mean by this is that I have taken ever so small thimble fulls of your full fat milk to supplement my measly vegan milk substitutes. Tea is just not the same with a load of processed, whitened hemp in it. As I take my tea somewhere between mahogany and anthracite this has gone unnoticed but the guilt has become insurmountable. To B. to tea and to your pure white heart; I am dreadfully sorry and I love you very much.

You are just attractive to me! Your vintage shirts, your blonde messy hair, your round glasses, your slightly nasal voice, your ironic socks, the way you carry your blue backpack. You make every sociology lecture a joy, I've thought so for over two years now, now is the time for you to know. I wish you were mine, I wish we could share a bed everyday, I wish I could cuddle you and let my hand run through your beautiful hair and kiss you. Please be mine <3 <3

To a Catz thesp,
That status on Theresa May was a comedic masterpiece, and a beacon of hope in these dark times. You are my left-wing Knight(s) in shining armour and your (peaceful and loving) fighting talk has me flustered. You're graduating soon, so this is probably a bit late in the day, and I hardly see you, but I think you're lovely. Help confirm that suspicion over a drink any time.

Dear M,
You look like you’ve walked straight out of a 90’s film
I swear you’re talented at everything yet you’re one of the most down to earth people I’ve ever met
You never judge and you make me feel more comfortable with myself (which no one can do)
You’re the kind of girl that people write about because you’re just the fucking coolest...

You're lovely, truly lovely. And I know I'm probably too young for you to ever see me as more than a friend, but I like you. I like how intelligent you are, how sharp, how knowledgeable you are about things I'd never even thought about thinking about. Most of all, I like your modesty and purity and goodness in spite of how amazing you really are. I know I'm not good enough for you, but I hope one day you'll look at me and see someone other than a friend.
